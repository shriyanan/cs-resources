## Resources for CS Classes

These are resources I found helpful while taking these classes at Berkeley! Bottom line, work hard, stay positive, and find good friends who you can collaborate study together through these classes. I'm also always here to talk or give advice (although I am no expert). If there's anything I can do to help, reach out to shriyanan@berkeley.edu and I'll get back to you. :) Best of luck.

### [CS 61B](cs61b.md)


### [CS 70](cs70.md)


## [Recruiting](recruiting.md)

I also included some resources to help with internship recruiting. I know at Cal there's a lot of hype about securing an internship and all, but remember not to define yourself/judge others on their career plans. It's not the end of the world if you can't find an internship, or don't get a job at a big tech company. In fact, the people who've had the most memorable summers spend them not at internships, doing work for super cool smaller startups, or traveling abroad.
