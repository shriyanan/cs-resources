# Resources for CS Classes

These are resources I found helpful while taking these classes at Berkeley! Bottom line, work hard, stay positive, and find good friends who you can collaborate study together through these classes. I'm also always here to talk or give advice (although I am no expert). If there's anything I can do to help, reach out to shriyanan@berkeley.edu and I'll get back to you. :) Best of luck.
