# Resources for CS Classes

These are resources I found helpful while taking these classes at Berkeley! Bottom line, work hard, stay positive, and find good friends who you can collaborate study together through these classes. I'm also always here to talk or give advice (although I am no expert). If there's anything I can do to help, reach out to shriyanan@berkeley.edu and I'll get back to you. :) Best of luck. 

## CS 61A

### Sample Exams

It's a must to take practice tests before each exam.

## CS 61B

All in all, this course is quite project heavy. If you put your head down, attend office hours if you need, and solve the projects, I think you will have a good time. Personally, this class was a lot more based off of hard work (compared to 61A's puzzles that we had to solve on the spot).

I'd recommend joining a CSM section and attending discussion. It's really good to have routine review through this. 

Kartik's material is all pretty helpful. I'd recommend checking out his textbook for any specific concepts you'd like to review.

### Sample Exams

When it comes to exams, it's not about how many you can take, it's making the most of each one. That means really sitting down for the allotted time, and doing the exam in an environment similar to the actual exam. Also, taking the time to review each of your mistakes.
