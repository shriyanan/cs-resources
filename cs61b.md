## CS 61B

All in all, this course is quite project heavy. If you put your head down, attend office hours if you need, and solve the projects, I think you will have a good time. Personally, this class was a lot more based off of hard work (compared to 61A's puzzles that we had to solve on the spot).

I'd recommend joining a CSM section and attending discussion. It's really good to have routine review through this. 

Kartik's material is all pretty helpful. I'd recommend checking out his textbook for any specific concepts you'd like to review.

### Sample Exams

When it comes to exams, it's not about how many you can take, it's making the most of each one. That means really sitting down for the allotted time, and doing the exam in an environment similar to the actual exam. Also, taking the time to review each of your mistakes.
