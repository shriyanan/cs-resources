## CS 61A

### Sample Exams

I recommend taking practice tests before each exam to gain confidence, and get a sample of what the tests are going to look like.

[Tau Beta Pi Library of Exams](https://tbp.berkeley.edu/courses/cs/61a/)

[HKN Library of Exams](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/exams/course/cs/61a)

*You can also find exams other students/orgs have made over the years, but prioritize the released exams*
